- Add header to page with text "Salary Calculator"
    - center text
- Add a section for input
    - add input header with text "Add Employee"
    - add five input boxes (a form element) for "First Name", "Last Name", "ID number", "Title", "Annual Salary"
        - insert onsubmit="onSubmit(event)" attribute to form element to trigger onSubmit(event) function to run when you click the submit button
        - add placeholder text for each input box
    - add "Submit" button (with text "Submit")
    - create an onSubmit function to:
        - add row to table (<tr>) with corresponding info in each corresponding column
        - within onSubmit function, call an event.preventDefault() function to override default form settings
        - reset form input values to zero upon clicking submit:
            - select for 
        - 
- Add a section for employee table (form)
    - Add section (I guess?) for a label *above* the actual table
    - Add table to section for the actual table
        - Add table header with labels for each column (<td> element for each column)
        - Add delete button <td>
            - Create deleteEmployee function to delete the ROW from the table if (read: event) you click the delete button 
- Add footer to display "Total Monthly Budget"
    - make a variable totalMonthly and set initial value equal to zero
    - set its value equal to the sum of employee salaries...
    - create a sumSalaries function to add all of the employee salaries together
       [maybe save this process for the stretch goal - loop through table?
        - for each 
        - select for the annualSalaryInput value of the selected employee]
    
==> For stretch goal, you would have to push each employee into an array as an employee and then loop through the array
in order to sum all of the annual salaries. And also probably create a decrementSalary function
